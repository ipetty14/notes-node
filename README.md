# Notes-Node

## This is a simple notes application I am working on in Node.js.

To run this app as of right now:
1. Install (https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js")
2. Clone directory and navigate to it
3. Run command "npm install" in the directory
4. Run command (node app.js add --title "Your title" --body "Your note body")

I will include a table of the commands to run once I have them completed.
